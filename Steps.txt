Cleaning
1.Data was read using pandas
2.All NaN values where replaced by ' '
3.train_x,test_x were stacked vertically and then count vectorized together
4. Each column was was count vectorized seprately
5.Result was horizontally stacked with the company name column
6.Using slicing train_x,test_x were separated and were stored
Prediction
1.train_x,test_x,train_y were laoded
2.Multinomial naive bayes model was trained using for loop and partial fit as data was too large to store in memory.
3.prediction was made on basis of model
